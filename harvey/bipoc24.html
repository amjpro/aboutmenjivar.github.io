                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dr. Erica Glasper was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. 
                                        Growing up, she was a member of her elementary school's 
                                        program for “Gifted and Talented” students. For high school, 
                                        Glasper was accepted into a Magnet School for Health and Science 
                                        Professions. As a student at this institution, Glasper had the unique 
                                        opportunity to take many classes at the Eastern Virginia Medical 
                                        School during her high school years (Ribic, 2021).</li>
                                    <li>Despite having this scientific and medical background, Glasper 
                                        did not enter college with a set career in mind. Her career aspirations 
                                        changed multiple times throughout her schooling. For years, she wanted 
                                        to be a lawyer. In high school, her sights shifted to cardiothoracic surgery. 
                                        It was not until she was in college that she discovered her desire to 
                                        become a scientist. Furthermore, it was not until later in her college 
                                        years that she decided on neuroscience as her area of specialty (Ribic, 2021).</li>

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology 
                                        from Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. She went on 
                                        to receive both her Master of Arts Degree in Psychology and her 
                                        PhD in Psychobiology and Behavioral Neuroscience from Ohio State 
                                        University (“Erica Glasper, Phd: Ohio State College of Medicine”, 
                                        n.d.). During her graduate years at Ohio State, she studied 
                                        how health outcomes are altered by positive social interactions (Ribic, 2021).</li>
                                    <li>After receiving her PhD, Dr. Glasper completed postdoctoral 
                                        training from the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton 
                                        University. During her five years here, she mainly studied brain 
                                        plasticity. This influenced her current work as an independent 
                                        researcher (Ribic, 2021).</li>

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper's Lab at Ohio State University focuses on neuronal 
                                        plasticity. Specifically, she studies how both rewarding and 
                                        stressful experiences affect the structure and functions of 
                                        our brains. Her research is very interdisciplinary, combining 
                                        knowledge and techniques from behavioral endocrinology, 
                                        psychoneuroimmunology, and behavioral genetics  (“Erica Glasper,

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper has made great contributions to the field of neuroscience. 
                                        Her lab was the first to observe alterations in hippocampal dendritic 
                                        morphology and behavioral function induced by social bonding and 
                                        fatherhood in mice (Ribic, 2021). In other words, she confirmed 
                                        that the brains of new fathers undergo structural changes when 
                                        they interact with their children.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>In her research, Dr. Glasper focuses on neuroplasticity. This 
                                        is a process that involves long-term potentiation, a process in 
                                        which strong, repeated receptor activation results in the strengthening 
                                        of synaptic transmission. Moreover, she also studies neurogenesis in the 
                                        hippocampus of adult California mice and how the process is affected 
                                        by parental behavior. Both neurogenesis and neuroplasticity are topics 
                                        we covered extensively in class (Bear et al., 2016).</li>
