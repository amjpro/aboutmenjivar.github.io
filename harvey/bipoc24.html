                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dr. Erica Glasper was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. 
                                        Growing up, she was a member of her elementary school's 
                                        program for “Gifted and Talented” students. For high school, 
                                        Glasper was accepted into a Magnet School for Health and Science 
                                        Professions. As a student at this institution, Glasper had the unique 
                                        opportunity to take many classes at the Eastern Virginia Medical 
                                        School during her high school years (Ribic, 2021).</li>
                                    <li>Despite having this scientific and medical background, Glasper 
                                        did not enter college with a set career in mind. Her career aspirations 
                                        changed multiple times throughout her schooling. For years, she wanted 
                                        to be a lawyer. In high school, her sights shifted to cardiothoracic surgery. 
                                        It was not until she was in college that she discovered her desire to 
                                        become a scientist. Furthermore, it was not until later in her college 
                                        years that she decided on neuroscience as her area of specialty (Ribic, 2021).</li>

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology 
                                        from Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. She went on 
                                        to receive both her Master of Arts Degree in Psychology and her 
                                        PhD in Psychobiology and Behavioral Neuroscience from Ohio State 
                                        University (“Erica Glasper, Phd: Ohio State College of Medicine”, 
                                        n.d.). During her graduate years at Ohio State, she studied 
                                        how health outcomes are altered by positive social interactions (Ribic, 2021).</li>
                                    <li>After receiving her PhD, Dr. Glasper completed postdoctoral 
                                        training from the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton 
                                        University. During her five years here, she mainly studied brain 
                                        plasticity. This influenced her current work as an independent 
                                        researcher (Ribic, 2021).</li>

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper's Lab at Ohio State University focuses on neuronal 
                                        plasticity. Specifically, she studies how both rewarding and 
                                        stressful experiences affect the structure and functions of 
                                        our brains. Her research is very interdisciplinary, combining 
                                        knowledge and techniques from behavioral endocrinology, 
                                        psychoneuroimmunology, and behavioral genetics  (“Erica Glasper,

                                    <li>Dr. Glasper has made great contributions to the field of neuroscience. 
                                        Her lab was the first to observe alterations in hippocampal dendritic 
                                        morphology and behavioral function induced by social bonding and 
                                        fatherhood in mice (Ribic, 2021). In other words, she confirmed 
                                        that the brains of new fathers undergo structural changes when 
                                        they interact with their children.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>In her research, Dr. Glasper focuses on neuroplasticity. This 
                                        is a process that involves long-term potentiation, a process in 
                                        which strong, repeated receptor activation results in the strengthening 
                                        of synaptic transmission. Moreover, she also studies neurogenesis in the 
                                        hippocampus of adult California mice and how the process is affected 
                                        by parental behavior. Both neurogenesis and neuroplasticity are topics 
                                        we covered extensively in class (Bear et al., 2016).</li>

                                        and the risks involved with alcohol and cannabis use disorders.

                                    <li>Dr. Zu Wei Zhai's research covered the topics of childhood 
                                        development as well as the role that addiction plays in 
                                        developing children.  He also was involved in research studies 
                                        related to self-regulation behaviors and the cognitive knowledge 
                                        behind the function of this topic.</li>
                                    <li>In one specific study he took part in, it included studies surrounding 
                                        mental health concerns, insomnia, and loneliness among intern doctors. 
                                        In our neuroscience class, one of our later lessons overlapped with the 
                                        ideas presented in the study, specifically related to sleep, insomnia, 
                                        and mental health.  Although the lesson does not cover insomnia specifically, 
                                        it does mention that a deprivation of REM-sleep can cause issues with 
                                        working memory and certain daily tasks (Bear, 2016).</li>
                                    <li>In relation to mental illnesses both Dr. Zu Wei Zhai's work and the 
                                        information presented in the later lesson of the class presented more 
                                        knowledge regarding a stimulus-response that is occurring in the brain 
                                        to cause an increase in stress and fear (Bear, 2016).  There are several 
                                        factors that affect the occurrence of a stressor, like loneliness while 
                                        being an intern doctor throughout the pandemic, as studied in Dr. Zu Wei 
                                        Zhai's research.</li>

                                    <li>Lee's interest in neuroscience was strengthened during

                                    <li>In 1999, he earned a B.S. in chemistry at Lincoln University in 
                                        Pennsylvania. He then went on to receive a PhD in pharmaceutical

                                    <li>Lee's career began in 2005 with postdoctoral training at the 
                                        University of South Florida (USF) College of Medicine. He later 
                                        became an Assistant Professor in 2010 and Associate Professor 
                                        in 2017 at the Byrd Alzheimer's Institute at USF. In 2018, he

                                    <li>The Dan Lee Lab has three main research goals. The first is examining 
                                        the role of polyamines, or substances with two or more amino groups 
                                        (NH2) (Lee 2022), in tauopathies, which are diseases that can cause 
                                        problems with cognition and abnormal behavior (Sandusky-Beltran et 
                                        al. 2021). The lab found that polyamines normally prevent tau proteins 
                                        from forming clusters, but polyamines with an acetyl group cannot 
                                        do this (Dan Lee Lab 2021). This has enormous implications for using 
                                        the polyamine pathway as a way to combat conditions like Alzheimer's 
                                        Disease (Sandusky-Beltran et al. 2021).</li>
                                    <li>Additionally, Lee works to further understand the effects of the arginine 
                                        sensing pathway (Lee 2022). Certain amino acids, especially arginine, 
                                        bind to receptor protein known as GPCR6a, which activates a protein 
                                        complex called mTORC1. The lab hypothesizes that this pathway senses 
                                        the concentration of arginine outside of cells (Dan Lee Lab 2021). 
                                        Research shows that alterations of the GPCR6a cell signaling pathway 
                                        and arginine sensing are associated with behavioral impairments like 
                                        Alzheimer's Disease (Lee 2022). For example, one of his studies found 
                                        abnormal arginine metabolism in mice with a human mutation in the gene 
                                        that expresses the tau protein (Vemula et al. 2019).</li>
                                    <li>Lee's third research focus is citrullination, which converts arginine 
                                        to citrulline, another amino acid (Lee 2022). This is an alteration 
                                        that occurs after translation, or the ribosomal protein synthesis using 
                                        an mRNA template. It has been shown to neutralize proteins that 
                                        previously had a positive charge (Dan Lee Lab 2021). He found that 
                                        tau and similar proteins undergo citrullination. This supports the 
                                        research that associates excessive citrullination with diseases like 
                                        rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of 
                                        dementia (Lee 2022).</li>

                                    <li>One of the concepts of NSCI 175 that Lee's research relates 
                                        to is the basic functions of neurons and glia. We learned that 
                                        microtubules are lengthy, tube-like structures that run down 
                                        axons. There are certain microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), 
                                        one of which is tau. During Alzheimer's Disease, the tau breaks 
                                        away from the microtubules and collects in the soma, contributing 
                                        to the degeneration of axons.</li>
                                    <li>This research also relates to the introduction to synaptic 
                                        transmission and neurotransmitters, which was an integral 
                                        part of this course. Lee studies the structure and function 
                                        of polyamines, which impact behavior and have been implicated 
                                        in tauopathies and other diseases caused by protein misfolding. 
                                        NSCI 175 taught us about amine neurotransmitters like 
                                        acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), 
                                        that only have one amine group. These chemicals impact behavior 
                                        as well, and have wide-ranging effects on movement, mood, and sleep.</li>
                                    <li>G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), or metabotropic receptors, 
                                        were a crucial part of NSCI 175. We learned about slow-acting 
                                        pathways in which a ligand binds to a GPCR and activates G-proteins, 
                                        which activate effector enzymes and second messengers downstream. 
                                        The arginine sensing pathway that Lee takes interest in is an 
                                        example of such a pathway. Arginine is usually the ligand, GPCR6a 
                                        is the G-protein, mTORC1 is the downstream complex.</li>

                                        to help athletes and thought maybe she could do something

                                        Athletic Training education programs in the nation, Dr. Shelby Biaz 
                                        got an offer to join the master's program which is why she attended 
                                        the university. After receiving her masters she was already immersed 
                                        with the faculty and the research opportunities which is why she chose 
                                        to stay and receive her PhD.</li>
                                    <li>Dr. Baez received her Bachelor of Arts in Exercise and Sport Sciences 
                                        from UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina and earned a Masters of Science 
                                        in Athletic Training in the University of Kentucky with a 4.0 GPA</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dr. Shelby Baez is an expert in the field of psychology behind injury and 
                                        post traumatic stress. The neurologist has two main focuses on her agenda. 
                                        Her first focus is to identify consequences of maladaptive psychological 
                                        responses on the central nervous system. Her second focus is to examine 
                                        the result of psychoeducational interventions and cognitive behavioral 
                                        therapies on decreasing discord psychological responses after injury. 
                                        Her research aims to improve long-term outcomes after traumatic knee 
                                        injuries. Baez's research found sports injuries are damaging both 
                                        physically and mentally.  “Psychological factors, injury related fear, 
                                        and belief in our abilities greatly determine an athlete's return to 
                                        sport,” she said. “If a recovered athlete doesn't believe they can 
                                        accomplish a physical task it's highly likely they won't.”</li>

                                <p></p>

                                    <li>In one of her interviews she stated that she uses fMRI to measure 
                                        brain activity. In this course we have learned about different methods 
                                        used such as PET scans, fMRI, CT scan, and FMRI. With functional MRI, 
                                        a magnetic field is used to generate images of the brain and overlay 
                                        them with images showing the effects of the magnetic field on oxyhemoglobin 
                                        (a measure of metabolism). It is also discussed how fear can affect 
                                        specific functions of the body. Dr. Baez's main research revolves around 
                                        knee injuries and in class we have learned about the Knee Jerk reflex 
                                        which can help us understand some of the concepts revolving around knee 
                                        injury. In a knee jerk reflex, the spinal cord contains an intricate 
                                        network of circuits that control movement. Coordinated patterns of activity 
                                        can be driven by both local input from dorsal root ganglion cells and distant 
                                        signals from the cortex or brainstem. In concerns with traumatic knee injury 
                                        we can expect to see defects when it comes to the knee jerk reflex.</li>
